/**
 * An OWID stores the creator domain as text followed by a zero terminator,
 * and parsing finds the end of the domain by walking forward to that
 * terminator. A missing or corrupted terminator once made the walk run to the
 * end of the buffer, which is work whose size an attacker chooses. RFC 1035
 * section 2.3.4 publishes a maximum for a domain name, so these tests prove
 * that a domain at that maximum still parses, that a longer one is refused,
 * that a buffer with no terminator at all is refused, and that refusing a
 * hostile buffer costs no more than the maximum however long the buffer is.
 *
 * <p>The same maximum binds the write, because a library that can emit an
 * OWID it cannot read leaves the fault to surface at the consumer rather
 * than at the creator. The later tests prove a creator refuses a domain over
 * the maximum when the caller supplies it, before the private key is used at
 * all, and that serialising refuses a domain that arrived by any other
 * route.</p>
