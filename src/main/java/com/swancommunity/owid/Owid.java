/**
 * OWID structure which can be used as a node in a tree.
 *
 * <p>An OWID records that the processor operating the domain handled the
 * payload, and any other OWIDs covered by the signature, at the date and time
 * given.</p>
 *
 * <p>An OWID is only worth anything because it is signed, so a caller cannot
 * build one. An instance reaches calling code by one of two routes, being
 * {@link #tryParse(String)} or {@link #tryParseBytes(byte[])} reading bytes
 * that were already a complete OWID, or {@link Creator#createBytes(byte[])}
 * and its companions signing one into existence. There is deliberately no way
 * to assemble a half made one, because an unsigned OWID is indistinguishable
 * from a signed one to the code downstream of it and the difference only
 * surfaces later, when a verification fails somewhere nobody is watching.</p>
 *
 * <p>The state is read only for the same reason. The signature covers the
 * fields as they arrived, so a caller changing one afterwards would hold
 * something the signature no longer describes. The payload and signature are
 * handed out as copies, because a Java byte array is mutable and a caller
 * writing into one it was given would otherwise reach inside the OWID.</p>
 *
 * <p>The serialized form places the fields in this order. Multi byte integers
 * are little endian, except the version 1 date which is big endian.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>version: a single byte.</li>
 *   <li>domain: the UTF-8 bytes of the domain, null terminated, no longer
 *       than the maximum published for a domain name.</li>
 *   <li>date: four little endian bytes counting minutes since
 *       2020-01-01 UTC (two big endian bytes counting hours for version 1).</li>
 *   <li>payload: a four byte little endian length followed by the bytes.</li>
 *   <li>signature: 64 bytes, the r and s values concatenated. Nothing
 *       follows the signature.</li>
 * </ul>
