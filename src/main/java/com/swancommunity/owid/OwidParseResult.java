 * What a read of a serialized OWID produced, and why.

 * {@link #isSuccess()}, the OWID is {@link #getValue()} and is present only
 * on success, and the reason is {@link #getStatus()} either way.</p>
 *
 * <p>The three move together. When {@link #isSuccess()} is true the value is
 * not null and the status is {@link OwidParseStatus#PARSED}, and when it is
 * false the value is null and the status names one of the expected
 * problems.</p>

 * <p>A result carries no text taken from the input. The bytes came from
 * outside, so putting them in a message would mean logging whatever an
