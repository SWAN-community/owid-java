/**
 * Reads a complete OWID from a buffer, reporting why rather than throwing
 * when the bytes are not one.
 *
 * <p>The buffer is walked by index and every read is checked against what is
 * left, so a malformed envelope is a comparison that fails rather than an
 * exception that unwinds. That matters because the data comes from outside,
 * where whoever is sending it chooses how often the read fails and how large
 * each attempt is, and an exception for every attempt is a cost they
 * choose.</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here calls the throwing code and catches it. The exception
 * would still be built and unwound, so the cost would remain and only the
 * surface would look different.</p>
 *
 * <p>The same walk serves both reading contracts, which differ in one place
 * only. A whole buffer holds one envelope and nothing else, so the declared
 * payload has to leave exactly the signature at the end and a byte after it
 * belongs to no field. A frame is one envelope inside something longer, so
 * the declared payload and the signature only have to be present, and what
 * follows is the next frame rather than rubbish.</p>
